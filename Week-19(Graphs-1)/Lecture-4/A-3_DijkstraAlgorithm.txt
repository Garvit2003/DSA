1. Create a distance vector of size n and initialize all values to INT_MAX.
2. Create a set of pairs to store the distance and the node number.
3. Set the distance of the source node to 0 and insert it into the set.
4. While the set is not empty, do the following:
a. Extract the node with the minimum distance from the set.
b. For each neighbor of the extracted node, update the distance if the new distance is less than the current distance.
c. If the distance of the neighbor is updated, then delete the previous distance and insert the new distance along with the neighbor number into the set.
5. Print the distance vector.
