Here's a breakdown of the code:

The necessary header files (<iostream>, <vector>, <unordered_map>, <list>, <queue>) are included.

The Graph class is defined as a template class, which means it can work with different types of data.

The adjList member variable is an unordered map where the key represents a node and the value is a list of its neighbors.

The addEdge function is used to add an edge between two nodes (u and v) in the graph. The direction parameter determines whether the graph is directed or undirected.

The printAdjacencyList function is used to print the adjacency list representation of the graph.

The bfs function performs a breadth-first search traversal starting from a given source node (src). It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next and a visited map to mark the visited nodes.

The dfs function performs a depth-first search traversal starting from a given source node (src). It uses recursion to visit the neighbors of each node and a visited2 map to mark the visited nodes.

In the main function, an instance of the Graph class (g) is created. Edges are added to the graph using the addEdge function.

The adjacency list of the graph is printed using the printAdjacencyList function.

The BFS traversal is performed for each connected component in the graph using the bfs function.
